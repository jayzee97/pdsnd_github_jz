### Project Title
Exploring 2021 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey (NYCHVS) Data

### Description
This project explores public-use data containing responses to a survey of housing units and population conducted in New York City every three years. The NYCHVS collects data on a representative sample of units across all five boroughs of the city - The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island - to comply with local and state laws pertaining to rent regulation.

Data from this survey can be used to characterize the attributes and condition of housing stock in the New York City area.  Comparisons can be made between boroughs on subjects such as vacancy rates, occupancy characteristics, rental rates, and the frequency of maintenance concerns.
